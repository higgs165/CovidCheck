# CovidCheck

A simple, minimal Android app made using Dart to display statistics regarding COVID-19, both globally and per country. Android Studio was the IDE used for this app.

Stats include: 

- Confirmed Cases
- Deaths

# How it Works

The user picks a location from the dropdown button at the top. The statistics for that location or globally are retrieved using an API called NovelCOVID.
