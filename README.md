# CovidCheck

A simple, minimal Android app made using Dart to display statistics regarding COVID-19, both globally and per region.

Stats include: 

- Confirmed Cases
- Deaths
- Recovered 
- Cases Today
- Deaths Today

# How it Works

The user picks a location from the dropdown button at the top. The statistics for that location or globally are retrieved using an API called NovelCOVID. 

# Under the Hood

Programming language: Dart 
IDE/compiler: Android Studio

# Stage of Completion

Nearly finished, may need to choose a different API as some stats strangely show a 0. Will also add screenshots.
