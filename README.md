# Description

Android app built with Dart, in Android Studio, to display COVID-19 stats, both globally and per country. The user picks a location from the dropdown button at the top. The statistics for that location or globally are retrieved using an API called NovelCOVID. 

### NOTE: Despite it saying there are 3 contributors, the only one is me. I assume the other contributors are just issues with how I configured the email and username in Git.

Stats include: 

- Confirmed Cases
- Deaths
- Recovered 
- Cases Today
- Deaths Today
